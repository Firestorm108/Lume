Started designing a smaller, 2W version than initally expected (8w) due to ease of use. However, I did a bit more research and found out that it is possible to do it in a budget-friendly manner. I'm going to go with a 5w diode due to the supplementary components not costing as much as for an 8w diode.

Selected all the parts and researched a ton on lasers. Since I'm building the whole thing from scratch (not like a laser module that comes with a driver, cooling, heatsink, lense, and diode), I had to carefully select lots of parts. Cooling is extremely necessary in this case as the diode will be running at full or maybe higher than max rated power. To counter this, there is a large heatsink and two built in fans, which should keep it cool enough for short usage periods. I also am going to use some orange acrylic as a supplementary addition onto laser goggles. This acrylic will wrap around the front countering any initial light.
